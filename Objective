OBJECTIVES: 
This project aims to -
    1. To learn the concepts of irrigation and water management in agriculture.
    2. To understand the significance of soil health checking and related parameters, in relation to irrigation and agricultural produce.
    3. Monitor the soil parameters, checking for humidity, moisture, temperature etc.
    4. Design a control mechanism to take decisions such as whether to turn on/off a certain water outlet, and quantity of water to be supplied per unit time.
    5. Design a system to control water flow, i.e. a water flow control mechanism that can vary the water flow as per the control signals.
    6. Implement the above systems to work in conjunction with the other as well as with existing systems used in agriculture.
    7. Solve the farmersâ€™ problems related to irrigation and soil quality degradation.
